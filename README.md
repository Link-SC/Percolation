# Percolation
In this project, the QuickFind and WeightedQuickUnion algorithms are respectively used to conduct porous material penetration simulation experiments, and Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the penetration threshold. The running time of the two algorithms is used to compare their performance differences.
